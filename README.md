#Gatekeeper: NGINX co-process for SOA-style infrastructures

Gatekeeper turns NGINX into your edge service. Gatekeeper watches your [Zookeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org/) service
discovery paths and dynamically builds NGINX upstreams for them. Load balancers (ELBs especially) can be SPOFs and are
the first steps to madness. Cut out the middle man and let NGINX manage your upstream load balancing. 

Gatekeeper uses [Mustache.js](http://mustache.github.io) templates to build upstreams and locations using your
existing `nginx.conf`.

    {{#clusters}}
        upstream {{clusterName}} {
        {{#servers}}
            server {{host}}:{{port}};
        {{/servers}}
            keepalive 24;
        }
    {{/clusters}}
    ...
    {{#locations}}
        location {{context}} {
        {{#upstream}}
            proxy_pass              {{protocol}}://{{clusterName}};
        {{/upstream}}
        {{#attributes}}
            {{key}}                 {{value}}
        {{/attributes}}
        }
    {{/locations}}
    
With two small blocks of customizable templating, each time a node is registered or deregistered a new `nginx.conf`
is written and nginx sent a `SIGHUP`.

## Running

Build the agent as you would normally
    mvn package

A jar will be built in `gatekeeper-agent/target/gatekeeper-agent-1.0.0.jar`. Take this a

You can run the agent as below:

    java -jar gatekeeper.jar -c /path/to/gatekeeper.properties
    
I prefer to run Gatekeeper under [Supervisord](http://supervisord.org/). A config for Gatekeeper looks like this:

    [program:library-api]
    directory=/opt/gatekeeper
    command=java -Xmx128m -Xss256k -jar gatekeeper-agent.jar -c gatekeeper.properties
    redirect_stderr=true
    stdout_logfile=/var/log/gatekeeper.log

## Disclaimer

This isn't currently used in production. It's a minorly tested utility.

## Maven
You'll generally want to compile this yourself, but it's available on Clojars if you want:

Core:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.xorlev.gatekeeper</groupId>
        <artifactId>gatekeeper-core</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.0</version>
    </dependency>

## Service Discovery Implementations

Currently only supports Netflix Curator Service Discovery Extensions. Other implementations are trivial and can be
 implemented by including gatekeeper-core, and including your dependency in the resulting gatekeeper-agent build.

## FAQ

### Why Java?
I'm not good at C, I believe I'd make a leaky C-module. I am confident in my ability to write a stable Java co-process.
Additionally, Netflix's Curator library is also top-notch, better than any stock Zookeeper library around.
